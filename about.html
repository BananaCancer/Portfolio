            <p>
                Currently, I'm a student at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi and 
                I'm looking for an internship in computer science and Artificial Intelligence starting in August/September 2024!

                I have been studying computer science for almost 5 years now and I've been a part of a multitude of 
                projects ranging from web dev to deep learning and machine learning. But I'm always looking to 
                learn more. Especially in the field on AI, which I have been fascinated by since my childhood.

                I particularly enjoy the (almost) limitless potentiel of AI and the variety of applications that 
                are possible with it. As of now, I've mainly taken interest in fields such as computer vision 
                and machine learning but I'm always looking to learn more and would love to discover another field 
                or application such as AI-applied in robotics for example.

                Computer science aside, I love traveling and discovering new cultures, this is one of the reasons I moved 
                to Canada this year, and I don't mind moving again for any opportunity! Wherever I travel, I 
                also enjoy going hiking, which is one of my favorite hobbies.

                I'm also a big movie fan who appreciates movies of any genre (horror, musical, drama), 
                origin (Japan, India, U.S.A), or type (indie, classic, blockbuster).
